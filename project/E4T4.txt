# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.
- Implement WAF in front of the Load Balancer, using the OWASP 10 rules
- Update Security Groups rules allowing access only for the necessary resources
- Create a VPC with private subnets
- Make sure the S3 buckets have data encrypted
- Update the ACL rules, applying the least permition.
- Create a VPC endpoint with the S3 bucket


# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
VPC endpoint is not a guarantee that unauthorized access is being made, since the IAM permissions are the main rule for the AWS most resources.
Nonetheless the recommendation is if the IAM role is insecure, it need to be revised.


# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
No, the file would still be decrypt. To apply the change made in the Properties of the bucket is necessary to reupload the file.
However the best aproach in this case would be create the bucket and already set the encrypt property.

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
It would replace all changes made after the first apply.
The best solution is change the Cloudformation file with the security optimizations or guarantee the infrastructure code is only deployed after security validation.
