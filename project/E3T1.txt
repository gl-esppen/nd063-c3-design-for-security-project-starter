# Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack
Guard Duty identifies that an instance is being brute forced by other resource via SSH connection. This is possible due the VPC Flow Logs.
A "High Severity" record is emitted with the attacker and attacked resource, including IP, host, time and port.
Due the internal logs, it can also provide information that one of the account resources is trying to do an unauthorized connection.


# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.
According to the AWS documentation, AWS Guard Duty uses VPC Flow Logs, AWS Cloudtrail logs , DNS logs, threat intelligence feeds and so on, to identify and monitor potentially unauthorized and malicious activity.
They also are able to detect if a EC2 instance is compromised by malwares or mining bitcoin.
Guard Duty, based on logs, can access the account behavior to detect unauthorized deployments, unusual API calls and so on.
