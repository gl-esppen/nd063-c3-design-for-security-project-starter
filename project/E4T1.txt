A secure way to grant access to the S3 bucket public recipes from the Web Server is attach a AWS Role in the instance for that. With this, the instance will only have the permited access to the files and won't see the secret_recipes.txt
Another way would be configure on the S3 bucket a policy to only permit access from specific resources, such the EC2 web server.
However, the AWS Role solution is better solution because the management and version control.
