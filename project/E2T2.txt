Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

- Connection ports (FTP, UDP, TCP, RDP) very permisive, using 0.0.0.0/0 or permiting All Traffic.
- All connection and open to the world
- The ACL rule is very permissive, allowing All Traffic for all subnets. Also using the top priority.
- All subnets are routed to internet gateway
- The S3 bucket with secret recipes are not encrypted
- Some objects in the restrict S3 bucket may be public
- Is possible to access the root user in the instances

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.
- Restrict incoming access to only permited resources. For example, the web server doesn't need UDP or RDP connections.
- Only web application can have access to the world, the application server needs to be private and with limited connection access
- Create private subnets and private route tables
- The attack server needs to be on a private subnet, permiting only access by NAT gateway
- Update de Security Groups
- Update the ACLs with restrict rules and choosing which subnets are going to have least privileges.
- Encrypt the S3 bucket with secret recipes
- Make de restrict S3 private
- Create a patch for each instance to only restric users to access the root user.
